# Final-Project-CS260# Final Project
Mico Santiago
-   Create some tests before you start coding...
    Part 1 - We would see a 2D maxtrix representation of a graph, got the idea from
    a previous class where I made a checkers game in the terminal. 
    Part 2 - we would see a list of items that gives use the shortest path from our source which is 0. 
-   Implement a graph class with at least:
    

1.  a function to add a new vertex to the graph (perhaps add_vertex(vertex_name))
    
2.  a function to add a new edge between two vertices of the graph (perhaps add_edge(source, destination) or source.add_edge(destination))
    
3.  a function for a shortest path algorithm (perhaps shortest_path(source, destination))
    
4.  a function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example min_span_tree()).
    

-   Analyze the complexity of all of your graph behaviors

Part two of the final project uses this image as our weighted graph which we use shortest path on. The source node 0 is connected to 1. Taken from (https://www.xatlantis.ch/images/education/graph1_example.png)
